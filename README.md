# IGDB Aggregator

A little personal convenience utility for aggregating some data for my retro games collection. It ain't beautiful, but it does what I need for me. Feel free to use/modify if it's helpful or interesting to you.

## Running...
```bash
npm install
npm run execute
```

## Testing...
```bash
npm test
```
